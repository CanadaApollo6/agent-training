# Qwen3.8-27B on the RTX 3090

What a 4-bit build of Qwen3.8-27B looks like on this card: how it fits, how fast it decodes against the bandwidth
ceiling, and how much context is left for real work.

```bash
CUDA_HOME=/opt/cuda PATH=/opt/cuda/bin:$PATH \
  uv run --project 01-inference/envs/vllm 01-inference/qwen38-27b/bench.py --ctx 8192
```

vLLM JIT-compiles a kernel at startup, so it needs `nvcc` (`/opt/cuda`). Results are in `results/vllm-awq.json`.

## The build

[`cyankiwi/Qwen3.8-27B-AWQ-INT4`](https://huggingface.co/cyankiwi/Qwen3.8-27B-AWQ-INT4): 4-bit weights in groups of
32, with a bf16 scale and an integer zero point per group. vLLM runs it with Marlin kernels, which work on Ampere.

The architecture is the one from the token walkthrough, scaled up: 64 layers, only every 4th is full attention, and
the other 48 are Gated DeltaNet.

## Where the bytes are (21.0 GB on disk)

| Part | GB | Precision | Read per decode step |
|---|---|---|---|
| MLPs | 9.89 | 4-bit (+1.07 GB of group scales) | all of it |
| DeltaNet layers | 3.30 | 4-bit, small parts bf16 | all of it |
| LM head | 2.54 | **bf16** | all of it |
| Embedding table | 2.54 | **bf16** | one row |
| Full-attention layers | 0.97 | 4-bit | all of it |
| Vision tower | 0.92 | bf16 | none (text only) |
| MTP head | 0.85 | bf16 | only when drafting |

- A decode step streams **16.70 GB** of weights.
- It also reads and writes **302 MB** of DeltaNet state.
- It reads **64 KB of KV cache per context token**. Only the 16 full-attention layers keep a cache; if all 64 did, it
  would be 256 KB.

The LM head alone is 15% of the bytes per token. This build left it in bf16.

**Ceiling at 829 GB/s:**

| Context | Ceiling |
|---|---|
| 0 tokens | 48.7 tok/s (20.5 ms/token) |
| 16K tokens | 45.9 tok/s |
| 32K tokens | 43.3 tok/s |

The setup notes' estimate of ~58 tok/s assumed every weight was 4-bit. The bf16 embedding and LM head are the
difference.

## Measured

| | Result |
|---|---|
| Weights in VRAM | 18.37 GiB |
| Room left for context | ~1 GiB → **10,119 tokens**, shared by all requests |
| Decode, short prompt | **32.3 tok/s** (31.0 ms/token), 66% of ceiling |
| Decode after 7,825 tokens of context | 30.9 tok/s (32.3 ms/token) |
| Prefill | 996 tok/s (7,825 tokens in 7.9 s) |
| Batch 1 / 4 / 8 | 32 / 112 / 117 tok/s total |
| MTP speculative decoding | does not fit: loading the draft head needs 2.37 GiB more |
| Sanity check ("17 sheep, all but 9 run away") | `9` |

Other constraints:
- The desktop holds ~1.2 GiB of VRAM, so vLLM can take at most ~93.5% of the card.
- Settings: prefill chunks of 2,048 tokens, at most 8 sequences.
- A 32K window needs 2.3 GiB of KV and failed; so did 10,240. 8,192 is what fits.

## What it shows

1. **It fits, but barely, and context is the casualty.** About 10K tokens is too small for agent work: a harness
   prompt plus a few tool outputs fills it, and Xiaomi's RL tasks run to 200K. On this card, the model's size decides
   how much it can *read*, not just how fast it runs.
2. **Decode behaves as predicted.** It reaches 66% of the byte-count ceiling, and it barely slows with context
   (32.3 → 30.9 tok/s at 7.8K tokens). That's the hybrid design at work: most layers carry a fixed-size state
   instead of a growing cache.
3. **Prefill is compute-bound.** About 2 × 25B FLOPs per token at 996 tok/s is ~50 TFLOPS, two thirds of the card's
   measured bf16 peak.
4. **Batching is capped by memory, not compute.** Throughput goes from 32 to 112 tok/s at 4 streams, then flattens at
   8, because the ~1 GiB pool can't hold more sequences' state and cache at once.
5. **The bf16 embedding and LM head (5.1 GB) are the waste.** GGUF k-quants quantize them too: Q4_K_M is 16.5 GB with
   everything included. At 5.95 GB, ternary Bonsai 2 27B would have a ~139 tok/s ceiling and leave ~16 GB for
   context. That makes low-bit quantization a *context* win on a 24 GB card, not just a speed win.
